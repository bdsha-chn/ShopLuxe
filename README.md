# E-Commerce Platform 🛍️🛒
ShopLuxe is a full-stack e-commerce platform with a Spring Boot backend and a dynamic frontend. Admins can manage products by adding, updating, and removing them from the catalog, while developing customer friendly website where they can browse products,
add them to their cart, and complete purchases. This is for server side handling so that customers can use this site seamlessly.

## Features 🪄
### For Admin:
➡️ Add new products with detailed descriptions, images, and pricing, stock availability, brand name, realese date.

➡️ Update existing product details.

➡️ Remove products from the website.

### For Client:
➡️ Browse and search products.

➡️ Add products to the shopping cart.

➡️ Checkout and complete purchases.

### Dynamic Content: 
Products are dynamically loaded and updated based on admin input.

## Tech Stack 🧮
### Frontend:
➡️ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.jsx.

➡️ Integration with the backend using REST APIs.

### Backend:
➡️ Spring Boot for handling API requests and business logic.

➡️ MySQL for database storage.

### Database:
➡️ Relational database (e.g., MySQL) for storing product.

### API: 
➡️ RESTful services implemented with Spring Boot to manage admin and client operations.

## Installation 📲📥
### Backend Setup: 🖇️
➡️ I have used IntelliJ IDEA Community Version Editor. Run *EcomProjApplication.java* file. In the terminal Tomcat will start on the available port number.

### Frontend Setup: ✨
➡️ Install extensions in the terminal using command: *npm i* (I have used VSCode Editor for developing frontend.)
